# General Guidelines
Seedream 4.5 and 4.0 support a wide range of tasks such as text-to-image generation, image editing, reference-based generation and multi-image creation. For optimal image creation results, consider the following best practices when crafting prompts:

1. **Clearly describe the scene using natural language**
   Use coherent natural language to describe the **subject + action + environment**. If aesthetics matter, include descriptors of **style,** **color,** **lighting,** or **composition**.
   * Recommended: A girl in a lavish dress walking under a parasol along a tree-lined path, in the style of a Monet oil painting.
   * Avoid: Girl, umbrella, tree-lined street, oil painting texture.
2. **Specify application scenario**
   If you have a specific use case, explicitly state the image **purpose** and **type** in your prompt.
   * Recommended: Design a logo for a gaming company. The logo features a dog playing with a game controller. The company name "PITBULL" is written on it.
   * Avoid: An abstract image of a dog holding a controller, and the word PITBULL on it.
3. **Enhance stylistic rendering**
   If a particular style is needed, use **precise style keywords** or **reference images** to achieve better results.

4. **Improve text rendering accuracy**
   Use **double quotation marks** for the text that needs to appear in the generated image.
   * Recommended: Generate a poster with the title "Seedream 4.5".
   * Avoid: Generate a poster titled Seedream 4.5.
5. **Clearly define image editing goals and fixed elements**
   Use **concise**, **unambiguous** **instructions** for modifications. Avoid vague pronouns. If other elements should remain unchanged, specify that explicitly.
   * Recommended: Dress the tallest panda in pink Peking Opera costume and headgear, keeping its pose unchanged.
   * Avoid: Put that one in pink clothes.

## Text-to-Image
Use clear and detailed **natural language** to describe the scene. For complex images, describe elements thoroughly to control the output precisely.
> Compared to the older version Seedream 3.0, Seedream 4.5 and 4.0 have a stronger understanding of text prompts, allowing it to generate the expected images with less description, and **the images are no longer washed out**. Therefore, when using Seedream 4.5 and 4.0, using concise and precise prompts is usually better than repeatedly stacking ornate and complex vocabulary.

### Reference-Based Generation
Seedream 4.5 and 4.0 support extracting key information from reference images, such as character design, artistic style, and product features, to enable tasks like character creation, style transfer, and product design.

When there are specific features that need to be preserved (e.g., character identity, visual style, product design), you can upload a reference image to ensure the generated result aligns with expectations.

When using reference images, clearly describe:

* **Reference Target**: Clearly describe the elements to be extracted and retained from the reference image, such as character design, product material from the reference image.
* **Generated Scene Description**: Provide detailed information about the desired generated content, including scene, layout, and other specifics.

Under the box, there is a book. In front of the gift box, add a round plastic base on which the figure stands. Set the scene indoors and make it as realistic as possible. The generated image should match the size of the original image. Position the figure on the left side of the image. The overall style should be consistent with the reference image, maintaining a cinematic photographic feel. |![Image](https://p9-arcosite.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-goo7wpa0wc/24c2dd7e60b9466ca9878efdade45bcd~tplv-goo7wpa0wc-image.image =404x) |\

When converting sketches (like wireframes, floor plans, hand-drawn prototypes) into high-fidelity images, we recommend the following guidelines:

1. **Provide a clear original image**. If the image contains text description, indicate "Generate based on the text in the image" in the text prompt.
2. **Clarify the main subject and requirements**, such as a high-fidelity UI interface or a modern living room.
3. **Explicitly define key consistencies with the reference**, such as ensuring that furniture placement matches the reference image and that the layout follows the prototype.

From front to back, the scene should include: sofa & green plants, television, dining table & chairs, and floor-to-ceiling windows. Do not include any text or hand-drawn edges from the original sketch. |![Image](https://p9-arcosite.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-goo7wpa0wc/3c29067cac8e419c9c9360e30a1f2bea~tplv-goo7wpa0wc-image.image =404x) |\
